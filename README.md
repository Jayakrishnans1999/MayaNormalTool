# MayaNormalTool
Over the years, I’ve often seen talented 3D artists losing precious hours fixing inverted normals — a small but frustrating issue that can derail project timelines. Whether you’re preparing assets for real-time rendering or baked workflows, these fixes shouldn’t be a bottleneck.
So, I built Normal Flipper Tool for Maya 🛠️:
 ✅ Smart Detection – Only flips the faces that are actually inverted
 ✅ Works with complex meshes, groups, and components
 ✅ Quick UI for one-click fixes
 ✅ Safe and undo-friendly
This tool is designed not just for my team but for any artist struggling to meet deadlines while maintaining top-quality models.
💡 My goal is simple: eliminate repetitive technical hurdles so artists can focus on creativity.
